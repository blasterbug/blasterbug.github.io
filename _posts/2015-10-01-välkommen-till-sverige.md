Since I live in Sweden, at least for one year, I start to translate my website in English... We should not be done quickly.

I am now a exchange student at the Umeå Universitet to start my master degree here. I should write a post about it, maybe. But currently I don't have free time for myself. Who think the Erasmus life is easy?

Anyway, my future posts will be in English.

```python
def test():
	print "test"
